# AWS IP Ranges History Tracker

Amazon AWS provides a list of IP Addresses used by their various services through a published [ip-ranges.json](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) file. This live file is available directly from them [https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json), but they only provide the current listing, with no history of changes.

Specifically, this file tracks the IPv4 and IPv6 IP Addresses for the following services:

 * Amazon Connect
 * Cloud9
 * CloudFront
 * EC2
 * Global Accelerator
 * Route53
 * S3
 * Workspaces

This Git repository tracks this file so that changes are easy to identify.  I've also split out the various services so that you can see the frequency of changes for each service.  With these updates, you can see how often and how significant changes are over time.

Note that Amazon [does not recommend](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=2051) using this list for mission critical applications.  As such, this repository is *for informational purposes only*.
